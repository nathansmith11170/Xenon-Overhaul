This project exists to overhaul the behavior of the Xenon in X4 Foundations

    Project goals:
        Make each Xenon enclave a standalone faction - this helps with concentration of force and distribution of economic jobs.
    
        Diversify Xenon - Make each faction a little unique

        Make Xenon Dangerous

    Project Non-Goals
        Factionlogic changes, aside from basic station finalization
        
        Preserving story state - Xenon will probably go ham.
            I will try to stop it from being impossible, but I can't guarantee
            that the plotlines will be possible or sensible.
